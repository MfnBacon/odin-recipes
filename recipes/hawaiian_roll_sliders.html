<!--Description of Recipe  -->
        <p>Hawaiian rolls are a guilty pleasure of ours: buttery and so addictive. Made popular by King's Hawaiian, these sweet rolls have roots with baked goods made popular in the Aloha State by Portuguese immigrant bakers in the early 20th century. Now, however, you can find them all over the country and in the hearts of each Delish test kitchen editor. These pull-apart sliders, layered with ham, Swiss, and caramelized onions, will be a MUST at any party you throw from here on out.<p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
                <p>Make caramelized onions: In a large skillet over medium, heat oil. Add onions and season with salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally until onions are caramelized and jammy, about 25 minutes. Let cool slightly.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
                <p>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Make poppy butter topping: In a medium bowl, combine butter, poppy seeds, garlic, and Worcestershire.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
                <p>Make sliders: Split slider buns in half horizontally and place bottom halves on baking sheet. Spread mayo in an even layer on bottom layer of slider buns, then top with half the ham. Top with Swiss, then remaining ham. Spread ham with honey mustard and onions and close sandwiches. Brush poppyseed dressing on tops of buns until all buns are coated.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>
